In case there is someone reading this, no, this project is not dead.
I'm currently finishing the scene loader and am looking into moving the project from autotools to cmake.

Most of the planned funcionality has been implemented

Even though most linux distibutions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Arch, Manjaro, Fedora) and even FreeBSD put the SDL2 headers
in a separate SDL2 directory in the include directory, apparently some people who install it manually, especially on Windows,
just throw these into the same directory as all the other header files. To be more compatible the cmake script will now look
for the SDL2 headers in <include_dir>/SDL2 and then in <include_dir> directly.
